        <h2>Ronna <br><br> Go <br> <br> 1999</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="text"> 
        <p>Where does Palace get her deadpan delivery? Her impulsive, go with the flow approach to her day? Her mother, Ronna. Syms makes films about how people continue to find a way after shit happens. After her wild last day, Palace gets on a train and heads home. Ronna wakes up in a hospital after a night of raves and drug deals gone wrong and just... heads back to work at the supermarket.</p>

        <h3>Travis Scott <br><br> Vine <br> <br> 2015</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        <p>Syms cites vines as one of her many inspirations for Palace. Searching through my mental catalog of iconic vines, I remembered an interview where music interviewer Nardwuar asks Travis Scott how he keeps his pants up. 
          I could see this racially coded interaction inspiring the art critique sequence. Travis Scott's response here reminds me of the way Palace handled her instructor's comments- with definitive bluntness. Palace shares this quality and status as a meme with her brother, Travis.

        <h2>Duke <br><br> Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas <br> <br> 1998</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        <h2>Father Duke</h2>
        <p>
          Duke passed down his love of drugs and sense of and disillusion to his daughter Palace. 
          </p>

        <p>Duke goes on a road trip on a quest for the American Dream, only to discover the corruption and decay that lie beneath the surface of American culture. This revelation exposes the stark contrast between the idealized vision he once held and the harsh reality he confronts. Just as Duke loves and disdains American society, Palace, as Duke's daughter, carries a conflicting mix of love and disdain for the art world.
          She's dedicated her life to art, but at what cost? She engages in art world speak of name-dropping and making empty statements while cringing at the hypocrisy that permeates the art scene.
          </p>
        
          <p>
            Together, Duke and Palace share a common thread of disillusionment, each discovering that their respective dreams are built upon flawed foundations.

        <h3>Myrtle <br><br> Opening Night <br> <br> 1977</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        <p>Like her granddaughter, Myrtle knows what it's like to be loved and hated at the same time. To be adored by everyone, yet completely alone. Palace's experience at art school with friends who act like fans and instructors who diminish her accomplishments, mirrors her grandmother's days as an actress. Myrtle and Palace straddle the line between acting and being in their respective corners of the art world. Everyone's always expecting something from them- a reaction, an outburst, a performance. Plus, they both love  signature shades.

        <h3>Palace <br><br> The African Desperate <br> <br> 2022</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        <p>Through Palace's patchworked identity, Syms challenges the notion of fixed identity and a universal concept of blackness that transcends history. This website visually represents Palace's figurative lineage drawn from the vast range of films, TV shows, cartoons, Vines, and memes that inspired Syms. There's nothing static about Palace as she navigates her final day at art school. She transforms before us through her interactions with her instructors, peers, drugs, and family. Her family tree of media ancestors deepens the stitches of the patches of her identity so we can see the parts that create the sum. Palace cannot exist in a reality where Frank Wilderson's concept of unchanging, transhistorical Blackness has any ground. We could not see Palace, the patchwork of memes, characters from sleeper hits, and personal experiences of the Martine Syms and Diamond Stingily that she is.
